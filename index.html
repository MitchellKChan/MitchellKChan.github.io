		<p>Hi there!  I am currently a third year Computer Science Major attending UC Irvine.  For the upcoming school year I am working as a Community Assistant for Vista Del Campo, one of the four on-campus apartment communities at UCI.</p>
		<p>When I am not in class or studying, I enjoy working out, playing kendama, spending time outdoors, searching for delicious places to eat at, and all kinds of board games.</p>
		<p>Thank you for stopping by, and welcome to my website!</p>
